(ns holyjak.fulcro-exercises
  "This is a series of exercises to help you learn Fulcro, via the REPL. See the README.md!

  How to use:
  - Load this file into the cljs REPL (using the commands provided by your editor)
  - For each exercise:
    1. Un-comment *temporarily* the exercise you are working on (by replacing `(comment ...`
      with `(do ;comment ...`) Shadow-cljs will thus evaluate the code and it will render.
      Tip: Hard-reload the page occasionally to get rid of residues of past exercises.
    2. Read the instructions in the comments, make your changes, wait for shadow to apply them
    3. Regularly look at what your solution looks like in Fulcro Inspect (Client DB, ...) to
       get familiar with this essential tool.
    4. Call `(hint <exercises number>)` to get help. Repeated calls may provide more help.
       Even if you want to do it without help, check out all the hints eventually. They may
       contain useful insights.
    5. When done, compare your solution with mine in the `holyjak.solutions` namespace.
    6. Finally, comment-out the exercise again and go on to the next one.
  - See 'Troubleshooting and getting help during the exercises' in the README

(comment ; 6 Client-side mutations

    ;; Enable the user to select individual elements or all at once
    ;; and delete these from the Client DB. (No remote in this exercises.)

    ;; Your task is thus to implement the mutations `set-players-checked` and `delete-selected`,
    ;; and trigger them in the :onClick handlers below instead of the current `println`.
    ;; Keep to the suggested inputs of those mutations, to make comparison easier.
    ;;
    ;; (Note: We could have structured the mutations in a simpler way. But this one
    ;; provides you a sufficient challenge.)
    ;;
    ;; Tips:
    ;; - It is often useful to put most mutation logic into a pure helper fn state-map -> state-map
    ;;   (often with the same name but ending with *)
    ;; - Get the current state-map via `(app/current-state app6)` to play with your code in the REPL
    ;; - Use Fulcro Dev Tools to look at the database and Transactions
    ;; - Check `(hint 6)` if you need help
    ;;
    ;; LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
    ;; - React to user actions
    ;; - Create and trigger a mutation
    ;; - Use and manipulate the data in the Client DB
    ;; - Understand the need for UI-only (`:ui/*`) props
