Lightly tested, but not heavily used yet.\n\n  General usage:\n\n  1. Set this nses `render!` as your application's optimized render function.\n  2. Create a class that follows all of the normal rules for a Fulcro root (no ident, has initial state,\n  composes children queries/initial-state, etc.\n     a. Add mount/unmount register/deregister calls\n  2. Use floating-root-factory to generate a Fulcro factory, or floating-root-react-class to generate\n  a vanilla React wrapper class that renders the new root.\n     a. Use the factory in normal Fuclro rendering, but don't pass it props, or\n     b. Use `(dom/create-element ReactClass)` to render the vanilla wrapper, or\n     c. Use the vanilla wrapper class when a js library controls rendering (like routing).\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```\n  (defonce app (app/fulcro-app {:optimized-render! mroot/render!}))\n\n  (defsc AltRoot [this {:keys [alt-child]}]\n    ;; query is from ROOT of the db, just like normal root.\n    {:query                 [{:alt-child (comp/get-query OtherChild)}]\n     :componentDidMount     (fn [this] (mroot/register-root! this {:app app}))\n     :componentWillUnmount  (fn [this] (mroot/deregister-root! this {:app app}))\n     :shouldComponentUpdate (fn [] true)\n     :initial-state         {:alt-child [{:id 1 :n 22}\n                                         {:id 2 :n 44}]}}\n    (dom/div\n      (mapv ui-other-child alt-child)))\n\n  ;; For use in the body of normal defsc components.\n  (def ui-alt-root (mroot/floating-root-factory AltRoot))\n\n  ;; For use as plain React class\n  (def PlainAltRoot (mroot/floating-root-react-class AltRoot app))\n\n  ...\n\n  (some-js-library #js {:thing PlainAltRoot})\n\n  (defsc NormalFulcroClass [this props]\n    {:query [:stuff]\n     :ident (fn [] [:x 1])\n     ...}\n    (dom/div\n      ;; ok to use within defsc components:\n      (ui-alt-root)\n      ;; how to use the plain react class, which is how js libs would use it:\n      (dom/create-element PlainAltRoot)))\n\n  ```\n  \"\n  #?(:cljs (:require-macros [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.rendering.multiple-roots-renderer :refer [with-app-context]]))\n  (:require\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.rendering.keyframe-render :as kr]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.rendering.ident-optimized-render :as ior]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.denormalize :as fdn]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.lookup :as ah]\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]\n    #?@(:cljs\n        [cljsjs.react\n         [goog.object :as gobj]])))\n\n(defn register-root!\n  \"Register a mounted react component as a new root that should be managed.
