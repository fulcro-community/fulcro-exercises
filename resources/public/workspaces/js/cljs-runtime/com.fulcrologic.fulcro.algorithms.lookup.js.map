This namespace exists simply to save typing and hassle with\n  respect to that.

Calls root render or optimized render by default. Renders on the calling thread.\n  - `:schedule-render!` - The call that schedules a render. Defaults to using `js/requestAnimationFrame`.\n  - `:default-result-action!` -  The action used for remote results in all mutations that do not have a `result-action` section.\n  - `:index-root!` - The algorithm that scans the current query from root an indexes all classes by their queries.\n  - `:index-component!` - The algorithm that adds a component to indexes when it mounts.\n  - `:drop-component!` - The algorithm that removes a component from indexes when it unmounts.\n  - `:props-middleware` - Middleware that can modify `props` for all components.\n  - `:render-middleware` - Middlware that wraps all `render` methods of `defsc` components.\n\n  Returns nil if the algorithm is currently undefined.\n  \"\n  [{:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/keys [algorithms] :as app} k]\n  (when-let [nm (when (or (string? k) (keyword? k) (symbol? k))\n                  (keyword \"com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithm\" (name k)))]\n    (get-in app [:com.fulcrologic.fulcro.application/algorithms nm] nil)))\n"]}
